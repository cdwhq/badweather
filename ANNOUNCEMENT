MathMap 1.3.4
=============

MathMap is a GIMP plug-in and a standalone command-line tool which
allows distortion of images and animations specified by mathematical
formulae.  For each pixel in the generated image, an expression is
evaluated which should return a pixel value.  The expression can
either refer to a pixel in the source image or can generate pixels
completely independent of the source.  MathMap allows the generation
of still images and of animations.

The MathMap homepage is

    http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/schani/mathmap/

It features a user's manual as well as screenshots and examples.

There is a Google group for discussing everything related to MathMap,
from questions to bug reports to feature requests, and so on:

Binaries for several Linux distributions are available here:

Changes in 1.1.2:

  * The command-line tool is optional to remove dependencies on image
    IO libraries.

  * Elliptic Jacobi functions for real and complex arguments.
  * New "ceil" function.
  * New and improved examples.
  * Several bugfixes.

Changes in 1.1.1:

  * A new syntax for declaring filters and user values.
  * Default values for integer and float user values.
  * Functions for elliptic integrals and elliptic Jacobi functions.
  * Better error reporting from the compiler.
  * The interpreter is broken (will be fixed soon).
  * Expressions can be saved from within MathMap.
  * The preview is bigger.
  * Works only with GIMP 2.2.
  * Unified binary for plug-in and command-line tool.

Changes in 1.1.0:

  * Compiler does several optimizations.
  * MathMap can now generate sequence plug-ins for Blender.

Changes in 0.14:

  * Compiles and runs with both GIMP 1.2 and GIMP 2.0.
  * Comes with a Language Tutorial!
  * Lots of new and improved examples.
  * Features a new compiler, which doesn't yet generate better code
    than the old one, but offers a much better platform for future
    improvements.
  * MathMap now automatically uses the compiler and if that doesn't
    work, falls back to the interpreter without user intervention.
  * All functions now use radians instead of degrees (which is The
    Right Thing).
  * Compiles on MacOS X (tested with GIMP 1.2 on Fink).
  * Bug fixes.

Changes in 0.13:

  * The command-line version can now read and write animations in the
    MJPEG Quicktime format.
  * A french translation (thanks to Laurent Despeyroux).
  * Bug fixes.

Changes in 0.12:

    tanh, asinh, acosh, atanh, arg, conj, exp (most of them
    contributed by Hans Lundmark).

    the image (thanks to Eric Kidd <eric.kidd@pobox.com>).
  * More matrix/vector algebra (including gaussian elimination).
  * The positive Y-axis direction is now upwards which is clearly
    The Right Thing.
  * Some minor C code generator changes which should not affect the
    user but easy writing of built-ins.

Changes in 0.9:

  * Lots of bug fixes.

  * Implemented a fast-preview option.
